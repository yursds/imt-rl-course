# 🎮 IMT Reinforcement Learning Course Repository

![Jupyter](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Jupyter-orange?logo=Jupyter)

This repository contains all assignments and resources for the **Reinforcement Learning (RL) course** at IMT Lucca, held by Mario Zanon. It includes implementations of core RL algorithms, training videos, pre-trained models, and Jupyter notebooks with explanations.

The code is not optimized for efficiency, and many lines are repeated, but I suppose that is useful for a simpler understanding of how to begin to approach the problem.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/assignments-imt-rl.git
cd assignments-imt-rl
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Using pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or with uv (faster)
uv sync
```

### 3. Run Jupyter Notebooks
```bash
jupyter notebook
# Open assign_X-Y.ipynb and follow the instructions
```

## 🖼️ Key Directories

### `img/`
- **Purpose**: Stores plots and diagrams for reports.
- **Example**: `assign-1/1-a.png` shows the policy evaluation results for Assignment 1.

### `saved_models/`
- **Usage**: pre-trained models to skip training.

### `video/`
- **Content**: Recordings of agent behavior during training/testing.
- **Example**: `video/4-3a/tabular/wo_baseline/` compares REINFORCE with/without baselines.

### `jax_utils_stuff/`  
- **[Tools](https://mariozanon.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/useful_files-1.pptx)**: 
  - `frozen_lake_sim.py`: Custom Frozen Lake environment.
  - `jax_haiku.py`: Neural network builders using Haiku.
